        <img src="imgs/Penguin.png" class = "photosR" style=" margin:0;"> Hi, I'm Zoe. I guess you're here to read about me, so let me give you the basics. I'm a grade 10 student at William Lyon Mackenzie C.I. who loves music, frisbee, and coding. In my spare time, I like to read (obsessively) while knitting.

        Among my various interests, I love to read. Reading provides a peephole into what life could be like, and is also a great way to escape reality. The greatest series of all time is <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> by J. R. R. Tolkien. I love everything about LOTR - the depth of the characters, the detailed worldbuilding, and the relatable themes that all add up to an amazing series. LOTR takes place in Middle Earth, an imaginary kingdom with elves, hobbits, dwarves, orcs, and more. Yet despite the fantastical creatures, the books retain a sense of realism and relatability, and are extremely well written, making LOTR my favourite series by far.

        Additionally, I love music. Music is a universal language that can convey more meaning than words. Music can be an outlet as well, a great way to relieve stress and engage creativity. For me, I find that playing piano can help me work through difficult emotions, and calm me if I'm feeling stressed. As well, it's exciting for me to play as part of a band or orchestra, because I'm contributing to creating a beautiful sound along with everyone else. As someone who plays violin, piano, bassoon and flute, I enjoy both wind instruments and string instruments. </p>
